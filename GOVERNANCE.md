# Governance

Agent Tokens is an open standard effort.

## Maintainers
- Initially maintained by the project founders.
- Over time, maintainer access may be expanded based on sustained contributions.

## Decision making
- Changes to the wire format require an ATP proposal (see `spec/atp/ATP-0000-process.md`).
- Reference implementation changes can be merged with maintainer approval, but should track the spec.

## Goal
Keep the core small, and push everything else into packages.
