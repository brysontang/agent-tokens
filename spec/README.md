# Spec

- `agent-tokens-v0.md` — the current living draft
- `atp/ATP-0000-process.md` — proposal process (“ATP”)
- `atp/` — individual proposals
- `test-vectors/` — cross-language decode/validation vectors (used by core tests)

The spec is intentionally small:
- core envelope
- extension mechanism
- one initial package (`at.intent.v1`) to prove the pattern
